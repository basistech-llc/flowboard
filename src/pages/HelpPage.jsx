## Flowboard

Welcome to Flowboard, BasisTech's new CRM dashboard.

[TBD] Usage

### Registration and setup

Flowboard is a front-end to several technologies. We are still in the teething
stage, so setup is not yet as smooth as we would like.  You will need to do the
following steps:

#### 1. Get an account on AirTable

Everyone in this first round of users should already have an AirTable
account. If you don't, please ask [Simson](mailto:simsong@basistech.com) to set
this up for you.

#### 2. Register as an authorized user

In order to access some features of Flowboard, you will need to be listed as an
authorized user of our CRM AirTable DB.

Add yourself to the \`Authorized Users\` table of \`BT Events and Funnel\`
[here](https://airtable.com/appuwUqhc3geVVy1v/tblUw4pyfWWipNdn7/viwPfv3fzz431MAMm).

#### 3. Get an Airtable API token

* Log in to Airtable:
  * Go to Airtable and log in with your credentials.

* Navigate to the Developer Hub:
  * Click on your profile picture or initials in the top-right corner of the
    Airtable interface.
  * Select “Developer hub” from the dropdown menu.

* Enter a AirTable Personal Access Token:
  * Click on Config in Flowboard's main menu
  * Follow the instructions there


#### 4. Register on the Fillout forms

We use a tool called [Fillout](https://www.fillout.com/) to create many of our
pretty AirTable interfaces. To protect our data, these forms require one-time
registrations. (And, unfortunately, sometimes they seem to “forget” and need
re-registration).

When you get to one of these forms, you will be requested to enter your
BasisTech email. Do so, and continue with the PIN code that you will receive by
email.
