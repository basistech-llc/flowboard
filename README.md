# Flowboard - BasisTech CRM


# Startup


## Dev mode

`make rebuild`


## Production

TBD

_(before we had wrapped this in Docker, it was `yarn build && yarn deploy` which put the
front-end up as a static app on GitHub gh_pages)_


# Usage

This is a wrapper around our Airtable account.

Authentication is still primitive. Follow the instructions in the Flowboard Dashboard
GUI. Basically, you need to obtain your Personal Access Token from Airtable.
